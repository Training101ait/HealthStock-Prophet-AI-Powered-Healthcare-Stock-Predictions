Since the meeting, short-term rates have moved higher but the long end of the curve has hardly budged on growth concerns (due to the Omicron variant). As the economy opens back up, there are now concerns that the Fed may \"overtighten,\" stunting future growth. For 2022, the market is pricing in a minimum of 3-4 rate hikes beginning in March. Meanwhile, the central bank's balance sheet continues to grow, topping the $8.87 trillion mark at the end of December from $7.3 trillion at the beginning of the year and $4 trillion pre-pandemic. The balance sheet consists of $6.2 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and $2.6 trillion in agency mortgage-backed securities. We expect the balance sheet to total almost $8.9 trillion once tapering is done. Future balance-sheet reductions may be done as a proxy for raising rates and to keep the yield curve steeper.
